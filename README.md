 This is another project that I wish my crush will check. 
 The codes are from what I copied from others. Just for learning records.
 I learned them long time ago but I had goldfish memory.
 It was like that I learned latex long long ago but I cannot remember anything.
 It was like others will think I am stupid.
 What if I am just bad in memorizing things? 
 Nobody trusts my robot character and bad memory and all they said is that I am stupid and doesn't have any logic.
 Or maybe in the past, I was not patient & scared of learning abstract knowledge?
 It seems that I have overcome my fear.
 我以前老被骂，我好激动，学习ai会让我感到我克服自己的心魔一样，因为我以前是一边哭而且看不懂，心理难受，还坚持学习。
 这次起码是看得懂和理解。
 可能是我对别人会很多数学公式和英文和编程啊，我就非常希望自己成为这样的人。
 可能激动是因为觉得，别人对我的批评不符合实际。我才是最了解自己性格的人。
 特别激动，终于学习这些知识时，不会哭和完整对照公式，知道为什么。
 等我以后慢慢补完那些数学公式和c++和python和java写得好一些，我一定会说，我是真的走了好远的路。
