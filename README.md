# ml_demo
 This is another project that I wish my crush will check. 
 The codes are from what I copied from others. Just for learning records.
 I learned them long time ago but I had goldfish memory.
 It was like that I learned latex long long ago but I cannot remember anything.
 It was like others will think I am stupid.
 What if I am just bad in memorizing things? 
 Nobody trusts my robot character and bad memory and all they said is that I am stupid and doesn't have any logic.
 Or maybe in the past, I was not patient & scared of learning abstract knowledge?
 It seems that I have overcome my fear.
