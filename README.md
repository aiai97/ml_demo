 This is another project that I wish my crush will check. 
 The codes are from what I copied from others. Just for learning records.
 I learned them long time ago but I had goldfish memory.
 I learned them almost 2-3 years ago. 
 I barely reviewed what I have learned before and it was a bad learning habit.
 But at that time, maybe it was because I didn't learn maths & cs as my major at college,
 it took me such a long period to overcome my fear about English and leetcode and maths.
 I promise my crush that I will spend most of the time learning engineering,not AI, after work.
 We have a private repo where he could check my engineering progress too.
 It can always make me excited because it was a long long way for me to go to be a better person.
 Everytime when I look back the old self, how can I imagine that I finally understand what confused me in the past?
 It is just like breaking down the past and walk towards being smart and patient.
 They all said that you don't need to be so exicted. 
 But I didn't learn any science programs before and in my previous mind, I think it is cool to understand a bunch of English & codes & maths.
 Everytime when I realized that I am doing what I used to think to be cool, I think it is valuable efforts.
